# Model Training Using CIFAR-10

In question 4 of the assignment i had a chance to learn about many concepts from researching the problem and watching the provided lecture
about t-SNE, i gained insight about how these plots could be utilised to view the results of a trained model aganist large
dataset and how well it would be able to distinguish between the different classes and be able to separate between them.

Using the CIFAR data set has allowed for the utilisation of various classes of different objects.

visualising the outcome that represents high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space as in the plot generated above provides a lot of insight about the model
performance. I come to understand that this technique is useful for various purposes across different fields. It also clearly shows the incorrectly indentified images
that are being clustered with the wrong class. This was something interesting to learn about and ustilise as it is a powerful tool and it is really interesting to see
it working in action!
