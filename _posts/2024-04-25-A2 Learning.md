# A2 Learning of New Concepts

## Question 1
While wokring on the assignment this question has really caused me to better use python programming langauge and improve my skills in it.
The use of python to the achieve the task required for this question showed to be really effective. Learning about all the different aspects associated with
fingerprints and how systems undergo algorithms to extract information from these fingerprint images such as minutiae and local structures was very insightful.
Doing this question has caused me learn about how to use databases for storing information and add to those databases whenever needed. Working with JSON files using 
python was really easy and was very effective in the senses that it could store information related to 320 fingerprint images. The fingerprint information is stored
as shown by the following image.

The JSON file storing all this information was about 135 Megabyte.

## Question 3
Before doing this assignment I was not aware of what Dev Containers are, now i have understanding of how useful they could be and very effective. Using Dev Containers
to train the birds model and making it run on GPU and CPU was really interesting to see. I had a chance to run the model on different machine and understand many aspects
of hardware by doing that. I initially run the model on my machine which has a Nvidia GPU 1650 Ti Max-Q, when running a batch size of 256 this has caused the machine
to utilise all of the resources it has. This image captured using nvtop command shows the utilisation of GPU and its memory. it shows that it ran for a long period
and the curves meant to show the utilisation are both at 100%. It could be noticed from the image as well how hot the device got and i could feel that from touching the
machine it was actually hot to the extent it burns, temperature as indicated reached 81 C this has surely pushed the machine to its limits.

When running this on the Lab machines the curves looked different as the GPU was different and had larger memory that has caused the model to be developed faster.
Seeing all these things in action through nvtop and using Dev Containers was very insightful and introdeced me to many things that i was not even aware of.

## Question 4
Another thing i learnt from this assignment through fastai was using Jupyter notebooks and markdown to write the solution to this question. Being introduced to all these
various tools caused me to acquire new skills.

For this question seening how deep learning works by developing a model that can recognise images taken from a dataset and the plotting the results provided me with 
knowledge and made me aware that this couldbe applied to so many different aspects in life. The use of tools such confusion matrices and t-SNE plots was very insightful
and got me to have a lot of appreciation to how useful these tools could be to assess the performance of a system.
