# Learning About Quantum Computers and Experiment by Nobel Prize Laureates

Reading through the IBM Quantum tutorial and the CHSH inequality i had a chance to become aware of an important application of Quantum Computers.
Experiment designed to test a theorem in physics was performed using a Jupyter notebook and python scripts that connect to a quantum computer. Understanding the physical
theorem seems challenging but the idea that an experiment that could be used to test a theorem of the scale of the one being mentioned in the assignment, it seems that
having quantum computers that could make this happen is very powerful and important to study about.

Just as the rest of the questions in the assignment while researching and writing the solution for this question i gained a lot of insight into different aspects of
science and technology.
